        Erika has been practicing Yoga since 2005 and after a few initial dips in other Yoga forms, has found her home in the Ashtanga tradition.

She attended her first Teacher Training during a trip to India and has been teaching regular classes ever since. She has attended a TTC with Kristina Karitinos in 2011, as well as workshops with Matthew Sweeney and regular classes with Gino Unterhofer in Vienna. Since relocating to Berlin in 2012, she has been practicing with Andrea on a regular basis.

An important focus in her teaching as well as her own practice lies in developing compassion for one’s own limitations and gently working through hindrances. She also finds it vital to take Yoga off the mat and integrate it into one’s life.
